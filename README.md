## Practice 1: Localized Vacuum Cleaner

### Goal

The objective of this exercise is to implement the logic of a navigation algorithm for an autonomous vacuum cleaner by making use of the location of the robot. The robot is equipped with a map and knows it’s current location in it. The main objective will be to cover the largest area of ​​a house using the programmed algorithm


## Practice 2: Rescue People

### Goal

The goal of this exercise is to implement the logic that allows a quadrotor to recognize the faces of lost people and save their locations in order to perform a subsequent rescue maneuver.
